Layer.Factory
=============
This Layer.Factory sample is a very simple Domain Driven Design sample application which follows the layered architecture pattern. The sample is used to illustrate the difference between the layered architecture pattern and the onion architecture. The namespaces in this sample simulate layers.

The sample is very simple. The idea is that the domain model behind it represents a factory which produces layers (what a coincidence). In order to be able to create layers a factory responsible for creating layers must be created first.
